# Data and Information Quality Project

This repository contains the implementation and results for the project assigned during the Data and Infromation Quality course (2022-23).
The project required to study how the use of imputation techniques to fill the missing values of a dataset can impact the classification performances of Machine Learning models. In particular, the provided code and report give a description of how Median Imputation and MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) Imputation can positively affect the performance of Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
